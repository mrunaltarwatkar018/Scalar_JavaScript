    What is Functional Programming?

        Functional Programming is a programming paradigm designed to
        handle functions in a better way in JS (mainly Pure functions).

        Javascript is a multi-paradigm language. We can use object-oriented, 
        procedural and functional programming paradigms all at the same
        time in JavaScript.

        Functional Programming has a few important concepts that we need 
        to know and understand. By implementing these concepts in your
        applications,  you will end up with more functional code. This will make 
        a huge difference in your application, making it more redable, usable.


    Key Features of Functional Programming:

        1. Imperative and Declarative way of writing code
        2. Pure Functions and what are Side Effects?
        3. Higher Order Functions (map, filter, reduce, etc)
        4. Composition
        5. Closures
        6. Currying
